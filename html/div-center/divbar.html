                    Transport in villages and cities is quite different, creating unique experiences for people. In
                    villages, transportation is usually simple, with bicycles, motorbikes, bullock carts, or shared
                    autos being the common modes. Roads are less crowded but often not well developed, and long-distance
                    travel can be difficult due to fewer buses or trains</p>
