1. Difference between HTML Webpage & React Webpage
Aspect	HTML Webpage	React Webpage
Structure	Built using static HTML, CSS, JS files.	Built using components (JSX + JS) that render HTML dynamically.
Rendering	Browser loads and renders full HTML each time.	Uses Virtual DOM — only updates parts that change.
Reusability	HTML elements are static; no modular reusability.	React components are reusable and modular.
Interactivity	Needs JavaScript manually for dynamic actions.	React handles interactivity with state & props.
Performance	Slower when reloading pages.	Faster updates — Single Page Application (SPA).
Data Handling	No built-in data management.	Handles dynamic data easily using state management.

•  HTML → Static & simple.
•  React → Dynamic, component-based, SPA framework.



2. Difference between Angular & React
Feature	Angular	React
Type	Full-fledged Framework	Library for UI
Language	Uses TypeScript by default	Uses JavaScript/JSX (optional TypeScript support)
Learning Curve	Steeper — has many built-in features	Easier — focuses mainly on UI
Data Binding	Two-way binding	One-way binding
DOM Handling	Real DOM	Virtual DOM
Architecture	MVC (Model-View-Controller)	Component-based
Size	Larger bundle size	Lightweight
Developed By	Google	Meta (Facebook)

•	Angular = Complete ecosystem (routing, forms, services).
•	React = UI library; flexible with third-party tools.



3. What is TypeScript?
TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript that adds static typing.

Example:
let name: string = "Mani";
let age: number = 25;
If you write age = "twenty", TypeScript will throw an error.
Benefits:
•	Type safety (detects errors early)
•	Better autocompletion & IntelliSense
•	Easier debugging
•	Used in frameworks like Angular and React (TSX)



4. Key Concepts
Term	Meaning & Example
Variable	Container for storing data. let name = "Lunar";
Declaration	When you declare variable: let x;
Initialization	Assign value: x = 10;
Lexical Scope	Variable access depends on where it’s declared in code structure, not where it’s called.
Block Scope	Variable available only inside {}. let and const follow block scope.
Function Scope	Variables declared inside function accessible only within that function. (var uses function scope).
Hoisting	JS moves declarations (not initializations) to top of scope. Example: You can use a var before declaring it.
Closure	A function that remembers variables from its outer scope even after that scope is gone. Example:

function outer() {
  let count = 0;
  return function inner() {
    count++;
    console.log(count);
  };
}
const counter = outer();
counter(); // 1
counter(); // 2



5. Why Node.js is used in Web Development?
Node.js allows JavaScript to run on the server-side, not just in browsers.
Reasons it’s used:
•	Handles backend logic, APIs, and databases.
•	Enables full-stack JavaScript (React frontend + Node backend).
•	Fast — built on V8 engine (Google Chrome’s JS engine).
•	Supports real-time apps (like chat, live updates).
✅ In short:
Node = Backend environment for JavaScript.



6. Which came first — Node, Angular, or React?
Technology	Released Year	Created By
Node.js	2009	Ryan Dahl
AngularJS	2010	Google
React	2013	Meta (Facebook)
Order:
Node.js → Angular → React
