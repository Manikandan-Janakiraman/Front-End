Form Handling:

REST Operator:
const add = (....a)=>{
    console.log(a)
}
let input = [1,2,3,4,5]
add(...input,2,3,4,5)



Async Process:

Synchornize Process:
In Synchornize programming code executes line by line (one after another)
Each line must finish before the next line start 
It means a single line executes take more time than the rest of the code will wait 


Asynchronize Process:
In Asynchronize process some task runs independently or else parallelly without blocking other code 
execution 

Handle Methods:
1. closure
2. callback
3. promises -> fetch, Async await, promise chaining, .then function 

set time out, set interval
Non blocking behaviour 

set timeout:
Its a function, runs a function once after a delay. 

callback function:
setTimeout((=>{}, time)) 

1000 = 1 millisecond 
3000 = 3 millisecond 
1lakh = 1 minute 

setinterval:
it also function, runs a function repeatedly every given interval 



Task:
setinterval setTimeout Syntax - 18 times 

const data = setInterval(()=>{

},1000)


const data = setTimeOut(()=>{

},1000)
