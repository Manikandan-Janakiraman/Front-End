callback():
A callback function is a Function parsed as an argument to another function
and its Executed after the main task is completed.

<script>
    const makeTea = (customerName, process) => {
        console.log(`Order Received for ${customerName}`);
    
        setTimeOut(()=>{
            console.log("Tea is ready");
            proess();
        },3000)

    }

    const serveTea = ()=>{
        console.log(`Serving Tea`);
    }
makeTea("Mani",serveTea)


</script>


callback hell :
Multiple Asynchronize process Pyramid of Doom 

const makeTea = ()=>{
    const makesnacks = ()=>{
        const makeBill = ()=> {
            console.log('Done');
        }
    }
}

makeTea(()=>{
    makesnacks(()=>{
        makeBill(()=>{
            console.log('Everything ok');
        })
    })
});

Promises:
To avoid the callback hell process we use promise Methods.
A promise represents a value that will be available in the future. 
It has 3 states 
    pending (still working)
    resolved (fulfilled or completed successfully)
    rejected (fail or error)


const makeTea = ()=>{
                        // parameters
    return new Promise((resolve, rejecte)=>{})
}


Promise Prototype:
catch, constructor, finally, then (once after another)

resolve - fulfill call back
reject - error callback
then - once after callback
catch - callback function 


You can chain multiple .then() to perform step by step operations 

(()=>{}) - callback function 

try catch:
try {

}catch (error){

}



callback:






Task:
18 times 

Promise syntax:

const makeTea = ()=>{
    return new Promise((resolve, reject)=>{})
}

//Promise ((r,r)=>{})

new = keyword
Promise = Methods
resolve, reject = parameters

.then() syntax - 12 times 




First create a callback function change to promise 

promise.all()
promise.race()
promise.any()

Interview Question:
What is callback hell?
how to convert a callback to promise?
How to avoid callback hell?
What are promises states?
What are promise Methods?
Promise instance methods fetch, .then, catch, finally 
Difference between promise and callback.
