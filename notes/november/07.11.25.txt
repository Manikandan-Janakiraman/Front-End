Local Storage / Session Storage / Cookie Storage

MVP
Minimum viable product - small Prototype

Local Storage:
-> build in web storage API 
-> store key value(object value) data in the browser permanently
-> data states even browser reload or closed 
-> Never expire until manually cleared.
-> 5MB capacity
-> js only access the space
-> Permanent 
-> do not send data from local storage to server
-> only accept the text format (json)

(under Application -> local/session/Cookie)

Cookie Storage:

-> A cookie is a small piece of data
-> data storage capacity 4kb 
-> send data to server 
-> tracking and authentication and sessions
-> key value pair 
-> Expiry date for cookie by the user 
-> only https available 


Session Storage:
-> temporary web storage
-> object provided by browser
-> stores data only for 1 tab 
-> once you close the tab or browser data delete automatically
-> Multi step form 
-> handle the temporary data 
-> based on session we insert print names
-> temporary key value storage object in browser
-> data exists only until the tab or browser window closed 
-> used to store short term user data secured on the client side 
-> SESSION storage mostly used in PHP

Storage size:   5 to 10 MB            5MB                      4kb 
                until manually       tab closed              configurable expiry date 
send the data       no                no                         yes

const userdata = JSON.parse(localstorage.getItems("userdata"))|| []
const store = {user,mobile,email,passowrd}
usersdata.push(store) 

localSttorage.setItems("userdatas",)

from one page to another page 
window.location.href = "login.html"


getITems - get the data 
setItems - set the data 

value.trim() - remove the space from front and back 

const data = dataparse.find((u)=>u.email === email && u.password === password)
