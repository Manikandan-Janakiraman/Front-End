Comparison Operators:

Functional:
Property, data are values stored in the process 

For Loop Condition:
A loop is used repeat the block of code multiple times 
until a certain condition becomes false. 

Automative repeated task 
Work with array and list 
Use for calculations (Math calculations)

Types of Loop
For loop - When u known how many to times repeat the process 
           When you know the no. of iterations 
           Mostly let used in for loop conditions 
           (Assignment operator, logical, arithmetic, Comparison)
           (Math Calculations)
While - When u dont know exact count depend on condition 
        (Once the condition is true)   
do while - when u want to run atleast one time before
           checking the condition 


For loop Syntax:  
for (initialization;condition;increment/decrement){

    //code execution Part
    //statement
}


While Loop Syntax:
while(condition){
    Statements
    Increment/decrement 
}

Do while Syntax:
do {
    increment/decrement
}while(condition){

}



For Loop Conditions:
 -> lesser than only used in for loop condition   < = lesser > = greater 
 -> decrement option means use greater than condition
 -> increment option means use lesser than condition 

 Example:
    for(let a=0;a<=30;a++){   1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,30
        console.log(a);
    } 

Daily Task:
Do Each for Loop condition 

 While Loop Conditions:
 -> lesser than only used in for loop condition 
 -> Runs a block of code as long as the condition is true.


Example:

let a = 1;
while (a<10){
    console.log(a);
    a++;
}


let a = true;
while(a){
    console.log(a);
    a=false;
}




do While:
->Execute the code blocks atleast once

Example:

let count =10

do{
    console.log("Running even if it is false");
    count++;
}while(count<5){
    console.log("count");
}




For Loop:





Today Task:
For Loop Syntax: 18 times 
Console.log (a+1) // Arithmetic conditions 
While loop Syntax : 12 Times 
Do While Loop Syntax: 12 Times 


Task:

for(let i=5;i>=1;i--){  // i greater than equal to, i decrement 
        console.log(i);
    }
for(let i=1;i>=5;i++){  // i greater than equal to, i increment 
        console.log(i);
    }
