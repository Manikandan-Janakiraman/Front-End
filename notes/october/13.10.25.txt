Javascript:
    -> High level programming language 
    -> Interpretator language (Code executed line by line)
    -> Dynamically typed language 
    -> It Runs inside the browser Engine called v8 Engine
    -> Firefox (Spider Monkey)
    -> JavaScriptCore: Used by Safari
    -> Chakra - Internet Explorer 
    -> High level engine - v8 Engine (Google)
    -> Single threaded process 
    -> Uses Heap + stack memory     (Important)

Types of JS:   (20% Interview Question)
    -> Math 
    -> Function Process 
    -> Logical things and code performance and understand your js.

Method, prototype, keyword

Variables: 
    -> Named container that holds data memory (ROm - Read only memory)

Keyword:
    Var, let, const 

    Var ->  old ecmascript1 to ecmascriptst5 (ES1 to ES5)
    Let -> ES6
    Const -> ES6 

Declaration Phase (Memory Creation Phase):

    -> Variable Keyword variable name; - Memory Allocation or creation 

    -> Variable name - (Not allowed - special characters, numbers Allowed - Underscore)
                        (camel case, upper camel case, pascel case, snake case) Universal cases 

                        Camel Case -> oneVariableBalance - first word letter small second letter, third letter word capital
                        Upper pascel case -> OneVariable - first word letter capitals, second word letter capitals 
                        Snake case -> One_variable - underscore 




Example: 
    var a;  -> Declaration Part 

    var firstNameLetter;  
    
      -> camel case
    var FirstNameLetter; -> upper pascelcase
    var First_Name; -> snake case 




Types of js using in web application:
    Internal - 
    External - 

    Access Phase - To check the output from outside the browser.

Printing Statement:
Syntax:
    console.log() - to print the output in console screen or developer screen 
    document.write() - to print the output in screen
    alert() - To check instant error or message 

Explanation:
    () - Function call 



Execution Phase:
    
    Initialization Process:
    variable keyword variable name = data 

    What are all tha data we have in js?
    
    Primitive data types(Store the value directly):
    Data types:
    - string - "two 2345 this is"  double quotation "sadfds123434" words , Characters 
    - number - 123456789012345678901234567890  More than number we add use bigint 
    - boolean -  true or false
    - null - no values, but in js showing the type in object 
    - undefined - declation without data    (Important: interview question) 
    
    Example: 
    var a; 
    console.log();

    - bigint - 
    - symbol -
    - Nan - not an number (multiply or divide any value by zero it will not be considered as a nan number.)


    Non Primitive data types:

    - Reference type - Use address pointer (Collection of data or process in single variable)

    - Array
    - Array of object
    - object
    - functions


Operators:
-> Arithmetic Operators  (+ - / * % **)
-> Logical Oeprators 
    && - AND Operators - When two conditions true, false means output true, false 
    || - OR Operators - false and true means True, 
    true-true = false, 
    true-false = true, 
    false-false=false 
    !  - NOT Operators - true means false, false means true 

-> Assignment Oeprators (=, +=, *=)  (+= represent as x=x+1)
-> Increment operator (++, --)
-> Comparison Operators
    ==  (Less Comparison)
    === (strict equal)
    !=  (Not equal to)
    >   (greater than)
    <   (lesster than)
    >=  (greater than equal to)
    <=  (lesser than equal to)

-> Tertiary Operators
-> Condition Operators





Task 1:
Use Var keyword - 24 times variable   Note and Git Link 
Use let keyword - 24 times variable 

Initialization Part:
    1. Use variable values string 24times 
    2. Use variable values let 24times
    3. Use variable values const 24times

Printing Statement:
    Use number (Each 12 times)
        var 
        let 
        const

True False:
    Use boolean Statement:
        Var, const, let 

Null:
    Const, var, let

Rules:
1. Keywords cannot be replaced
2. Variable name do not start with numbers
3. No space or hypen in variable
4. Case sensitive
5. use meaningful names
